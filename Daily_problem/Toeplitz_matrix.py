# A Toeplitz matrix (also known as a diagonal-constant matrix) is a matrix in which every descending diagonal from left to right contains the same element.

# Given a rectangular matrix mat, determine whether it is a Toeplitz matrix or not.
# Implement the function isToeplitz(mat) that returns:

# true if the matrix is a Toeplitz matrix
# false otherwise
# Examples:

# Input: mat[][] = [[6, 7, 8],
#                 [4, 6, 7],
#                 [1, 4, 6]]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The matrix is Toeplitz because every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements. 
# For example, the main diagonal is 6 → 6 → 6, and other diagonals like 7 → 7 and 4 → 4 are also constant. 
# Since all diagonals follow this pattern, the matrix is Toeplitz, so the output is true.
# Input: mat[][] = [[6, 3, 8],
#                 [4, 9, 7],
#                 [1, 4, 6]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The primary diagonal elements of the given matrix are [6, 9, 6]. As the diagonal elements are not same, the given matrix is not Toeplitz Matrix.
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ mat.size(), mat[0].size() ≤ 40
# 0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 100

class Solution:
    def isToeplitz(self, mat):
        n = len(mat)
        m = len(mat[0])

        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                # 🔥 check current with top-left
                if mat[i][j] != mat[i-1][j-1]:
                    return False

        return True
