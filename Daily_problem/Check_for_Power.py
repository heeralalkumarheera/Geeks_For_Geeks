# Given two positive integers x and y, determine if y is a power of x. If y is a power of x, return true. Otherwise, return false.

# Examples:

# Input: x = 2, y = 8
# Output: true 
# Explanation: 23 is equal to 8.
# Input: x = 1, y = 8
# Output: false
# Explanation: Any power of 1 is not equal to 8.
# Input: x = 46, y = 205962976
# Output: true
# Explanation: 465 is equal to 205962976.
# Input: x = 50, y = 312500000
# Output: true
# Explanation: 505 is equal to 312500000.
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ x ≤ 103
# 1 ≤ y ≤ 109

# Expected Complexities
# Time Complexity: O(1)
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def isPower(self, x, y):
        # special case
        if x == 1:
            return y == 1

        # divide repeatedly
        while y % x == 0:
            y = y // x

        return y == 1
