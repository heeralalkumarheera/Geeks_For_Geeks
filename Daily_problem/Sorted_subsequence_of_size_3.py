# Given an array arr[], find any subsequence of three elements such that, arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] and (i < j < k).

# If such a subsequence exists, return the three elements as an array. Otherwise, return an empty array.

# Note:

# The driver code will print 1 if the returned subsequence is valid and present in the array.
# The driver code will print 0 if no such subsequence exists.
# If the returned subsequence does not satisfy the required format or conditions, the output will be -1.
# Examples :

# Input: arr[] = [12, 11, 10, 5, 6, 2, 30]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: As 5 < 6 < 30, and they  appear in the same sequence in the array. So output is 1.
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Output: 1 
# Explanation: As the array is sorted, for every i, j, k, where i < j < k, arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k].So output is 1.
# Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 2, 1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: No such Subsequence exist, so empty array is returned (the driver code automatically prints 0 in this case).
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
# 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106

# Expected Complexities
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)
